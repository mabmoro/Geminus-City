// PoI compatability, to stop active edges.
// In hindsight it would've been better to do this first instead of making a billion /pollux subtypes above,
// but maybe we can transition to this instead now and over time get rid of the /pollux subtypes.
// The downside is if someone wants to use this in normal/vaccum they'll need to make a new subtype, but since the typical use case has changed, this might be acceptable.
